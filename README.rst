Usage
^^^^^

Import the library.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import census_data_aggregator


Approximating sums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Total together estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and approximate the combined margin of error. Follows the bureau's `official guidelines <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6162551-20180418-MOE.html>`_ for how to calculate a new margin of error when totaling multiple values. Useful for aggregating census categories and geographies.

Accepts an open-ended set of paired lists, each expected to provide an estimate followed by its margin of error.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> males_under_5, males_under_5_moe = 10154024, 3778
  >>> females_under_5, females_under_5_moe = 9712936, 3911
  >>> census_data_aggregator.approximate_sum(
      (males_under_5, males_under_5_moe),
      (females_under_5, females_under_5_moe)
  )
  19866960, 5437.757350231803


Approximating proportions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculate an estimate's proportion of another estimate and approximate the margin of error. Follows the bureau's `ACS handbook <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6177941-Acs-General-Handbook-2018-ch08.html>`_. Simply multiply the result by 100 for a percentage. Recommended when the first value is smaller than the second.

Accepts two paired lists, each expected to provide an estimate followed by its margin of error. The numerator goes in first. The denominator goes in second. In cases where the numerator is not a subset of the denominator, the bureau recommends using the approximate_ratio method instead.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> single_women_in_virginia = 203119, 5070
   >>> total_women_in_virginia = 690746, 831
   >>> census_data_aggregator.approximate_proportion(
       single_women_in_virginia,
       total_women_in_virginia
   )
   0.322, 0.008


Approximating medians
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Estimate a median and approximate the margin of error. Follows the U.S. Census Bureau's official guidelines for estimation using a design factor. Useful for generating medians for measures like household income and age when aggregating census geographies.

Expects a list of dictionaries that divide the full range of data values into continuous categories. Each dictionary should have three keys:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  * - key
    - value
  * - min
    - The minimum value of the range
  * - max
    - The maximum value of the range
  * - n
    - The number of people, households or other units in the range


The minimum value in the first range and the maximum value in the last range can be tailored to the dataset by using the "jam values" provided in the `American Community Survey's technical documentation <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6165752-2017-SummaryFile-Tech-Doc.html#document/p20/a508561>`_.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> income = [
      dict(min=2499, max=9999, n=186),
      dict(min=10000, max=14999, n=78),
      dict(min=15000, max=19999, n=98),
      dict(min=20000, max=24999, n=287),
      dict(min=25000, max=29999, n=142),
      dict(min=30000, max=34999, n=90),
      dict(min=35000, max=39999, n=107),
      dict(min=40000, max=44999, n=104),
      dict(min=45000, max=49999, n=178),
      dict(min=50000, max=59999, n=106),
      dict(min=60000, max=74999, n=177),
      dict(min=75000, max=99999, n=262),
      dict(min=100000, max=124999, n=77),
      dict(min=125000, max=149999, n=100),
      dict(min=150000, max=199999, n=58),
      dict(min=200000, max=250001, n=18)
  ]

For a margin of error to be returned, a "design factor" and sampling percentage must be provided to calculate the standard error. These statistical inputs are used to tailor the estimate to the variance of the dataset and correct for a finite sample. The Census Bureau publishes design factors as part of its PUMS Accuracy statement. Find the value for the dataset you are estimating by referring to `the bureau's reference material <https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/pums/documentation.html>`_.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> census_data_aggregator.approximate_median(income, design_factor=1.5, sampling_percentage=1)
  42211.096153846156, 27260.315546093672

If a design factor and/or sampling percentage is not provided, no margin of error will be returned.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> census_data_aggregator.approximate_median(income)
  42211.096153846156, None

Approximating ratios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculate the ratio between two estimates and approximate its margin of error. Follows the bureau's `ACS handbook <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6177941-Acs-General-Handbook-2018-ch08.html>`_.

Accepts two paired lists, each expected to provide an estimate followed by its margin of error. The numerator goes in first. The denominator goes in second. In cases where the numerator is a subset of the denominator, the bureau recommends uses the approximate_proportion method.

.. code-block:: python

  >>> single_men_in_virginia = 226840, 5556
  >>> single_women_in_virginia = 203119, 5070
  >>> census_data_aggregator.approximate_ratio(
      single_men_in_virginia,
      single_women_in_virginia
  )
  1.117, 0.039


Approximating products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculates the product of two estimates and approximates its margin of error. Follows the bureau's `ACS handbook <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6177941-Acs-General-Handbook-2018-ch08.html>`_.

Accepts two paired lists, each expected to provide an estimate followed by its margin of error.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> owner_occupied_units = 74506512, 228238
   >>> single_family_percent = 0.824, 0.001
   >>> census_data_aggregator.approximate_product(
       owner_occupied_units,
       single_family_percent
   )

A note from the experts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The California State Data Center's Demographic Research Unit `notes <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6165014-How-to-Recalculate-a-Median.html#document/p4/a508562>`_\ :

..

   The user should be aware that the formulas are actually approximations that overstate the MOE compared to the more precise methods based on the actual survey returns that the Census Bureau uses. Therefore, the calculated MOEs will be higher, or more conservative, than those found in published tabulations for similarly-sized areas. This knowledge may affect the level of error you are willing to accept.


The American Community Survey's handbook `adds <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6177941-Acs-General-Handbook-2018-ch08.html#document/p3/a509993>`_\ :

..

   As the number of estimates involved in a sum or difference increases, the results of the approximation formula become increasingly different from the [standard error] derived directly from the ACS microdata. Users are encouraged to work with the fewest number of estimates possible.
